AANuVis
====================
***A semi-automatic amino acid usage and di- and tetra-nucleotide usage frequency calculator and visualizer with UMAP***

## Step one
Use # AANuVis-count_local.py # for local fasta file AAU and di- and tetra-nucleotide usage count and convert into percentaged format

   Usage: python AANuVis-count_local.py fasta_file.fasta or nohup AANuVis-count_local.py fasta_file.fasta & for none-verbose
   
   Dependency: seqkit, prodigal, python

## Step two
Then use # AANuVis-Visualize.py # for visualization. Parameters are integrated in the code, feel free to adjust for individualized and customized uses. :-) 

  Usage: You have to change #csv_files = # and colors and dot_alphas in the code for customization.   Other parameters for visualization like grid_interval grid_alpha and such are customizable.

  In umap.UMAP, this is where you need to know how UMAP works, see 10.1038/nbt.4314 for introduction, or just any youtuber's video

  Dependency: numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, umap-learn
